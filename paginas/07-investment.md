### Hero

**H1:** Your Session, From First Call to Final Gallery

**Subhead:** More than beautiful photographs — a personal, guided experience from the first phone call to the images your family will keep for generations.

### Sección 2

**H2:** What You're Really Investing In

I'll be honest with you: if you're simply looking for the lowest price in the Tri-Cities, there are photographers who will serve you better. My clients are investing in something different — a relaxed, meaningful experience with someone who truly cares, and photographs that become more valuable with every passing year.

Here's what that means in practice: personal planning before you ever step in front of the camera. Wardrobe guidance so you look and feel amazing. Gentle direction all session long, so you never have to wonder what to do. And warm, timeless editing that will still look right decades from now — because these images aren't for a trend. They're for your walls, your albums, and the people who come after you.

### Sección 3

**H2:** Every Session Includes

- A personal planning call with me — your story, your season, your hopes for the images
- Wardrobe guidance before your session, so everyone looks great and moves comfortably
- Location planning around the Tri-Cities, matched to your family and the light
- A relaxed, fully guided outdoor session at golden hour
- Hand-editing of every delivered image in my warm, true-to-you style
- `[PENDIENTE: entrega — nº de imágenes, galería online, derechos de impresión, plazos — Q54, Q56, Q58]`

### Sección 4 — Proceso extendido

**H2:** The Experience, Step by Step

**H3: 1. You reach out**
Tell me who you want photographed and what this season means to you. I read and answer every inquiry myself — you'll hear back from me, not an assistant. `[PENDIENTE: tiempo de respuesta habitual — Q50]`

**H3: 2. We plan together**
We'll talk by phone about locations, outfits, timing and the little details that make a session feel like yours. This is where the nerves start to melt — most clients tell me the planning call is when they realized this was going to be fun.

**H3: 3. Session day**
Golden hour, outdoors, unhurried. I guide; you connect; the light does what Tri-Cities light does best. You'll probably hear "Oh!! The lighting!!" at least once — I can't help it.

**H3: 4. Your gallery comes home**
Your images arrive edited with care, ready to print, frame, gift and keep. `[PENDIENTE: turnaround — Q56]` And my hope is that when you see them, you don't just see beautiful photos — you feel *seen*.

### Sección 5 — Precios

**H2:** A Note About Pricing

Every session is planned personally, so I share pricing during our first conversation — that way I can recommend exactly what fits your family, your goals and your walls, instead of handing you a one-size-fits-all menu. When we talk, you'll get clear, complete pricing with no surprises.

### Sección 6 — Políticas

**H2:** Good-to-Know Policies

- **Booking:** I reserve most sessions four to six weeks ahead. `[PENDIENTE: retainer/contrato — Q51]`
- **Weather:** Tri-Cities weather usually cooperates — when it doesn't, we reschedule together for the next best light. `[PENDIENTE: política exacta — Q55]`
- **Illness & little ones:** Sick kids and hard days happen. We'll find a new date; the photos are better when everyone feels good.
- **Editing philosophy:** I retouch the temporary and keep the true. You'll look like yourselves — on a really good evening. `[PENDIENTE: detalle — Q57]`

### Sección 7 — FAQ

**H2:** Investment Questions

**H3: How much does a photography session cost in the Tri-Cities?**
Local sessions range widely — from budget mini-sessions to luxury studio collections. My pricing sits where personal experience and heirloom quality meet, and I'll share every detail in our first call so you can decide with clarity.

**H3: Do you offer payment plans?**
`[PENDIENTE: Q51]`

**H3: Do you sell prints and albums?**
