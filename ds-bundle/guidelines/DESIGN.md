# Delphine Rose Photography — Design System

## 1. DESIGN OVERVIEW

### Source calibration

This specification is derived from a single 1080 × 1920 px JPEG. The website itself is the centered rectangle from x=140 to x=940 and y=149 to at least y=1850.

| Item | Reference pixels | Canonical implementation |
|---|---:|---:|
| Presentation artboard | 1080 × 1920 | Presentation-only; not part of the live site |
| Visible website | 800 × 1701+ | Approximately 1500 × 3190+ |
| Reference scale | Approximately 53.333% | 100% |
| Conversion | 1 reference px | Approximately 1.875 CSS px |

Use a 1500 px desktop viewport as the calibration coordinate system. Every desktop value below is expressed in unscaled CSS pixels unless a table explicitly says “reference px.” To compare an implementation directly against the supplied image, render the 1500 px site and scale it to 800 px, or compare at approximately 53.333%.

The reference ends during the biography section. It does not show the true bottom of the page, and it contains no measurable footer.

### Source cross-check

The reference is a scaled capture of the [Delphine Rose theme demo](https://delphine.pixandhue.com/). Cross-checking the matching live page confirms the original font families, fixed hero/banner heights, color family, component proportions, and responsive breakpoints. Image measurements remain authoritative for the exact flattened colors and visible geometry; live-source values are used where they resolve otherwise unknowable details such as font names and mobile behavior.

### Aesthetic and design language

The design is an editorial, heirloom-photography composition built from:

- muted mineral and parchment surfaces rather than white;
- documentary wedding and lifestyle photographs with warm brown, olive, sand, and desaturated skin tones;
- high-contrast, uppercase serif typography for emotional statements;
- very small uppercase sans-serif typography for navigation and utility labels;
- a thin, airy signature script used sparingly over photographs;
- square-edged blocks interrupted by large semicircular photo arches;
- intentional overlap between photographs, section boundaries, labels, and one-pixel construction lines;
- generous empty space, especially above and below the portfolio card row;
- no decorative pills, glossy effects, glassmorphism, bright gradients, or conventional card shadows.

The layout should feel quiet, personal, romantic, tactile, and archival. It should resemble a carefully art-directed printed photography portfolio rather than a generic wedding template. The brand personality is intimate, assured, restrained, nostalgic, and premium without becoming ornate.

### Composition principles

1. Photographs carry most of the visual weight.
2. Color blocks establish rhythm; they are never mere card backgrounds.
3. Serif type expresses emotion; sans-serif type handles navigation and metadata.
4. Script type is a visual accent, limited to one short phrase per photographic composition.
5. Overlap is structural. Images and hairlines deliberately cross section boundaries.
6. All ordinary rectangles remain square. The only strong radius is the semicircular arch used for selected portraits.
7. Asymmetry is controlled: the story section is image-heavy on the left, while the biography section shifts its large arch to the right.

### Presentation mockup versus website

The pale outer canvas, the partially obscured still-life panels, and the heavy page shadow belong to the presentation mockup. They should not be placed inside the production website DOM. Include them only when reproducing the complete 1080 × 1920 showcase image.

For a showcase reconstruction:

- artboard: 1080 × 1920 px, background #F7F4ED;
- site preview: x=140, y=149, width=800 px, visible height=1701 px;
- upper-left still-life panel: approximately x=53, y=75, width=568 px, height=423 px;
- right still-life panel: visible from x=940 to 1027 and y=582 to 1316; the hidden width is not recoverable;
- lower-left cool-gray panel: visible from x=53 to 140 and y=1071 to 1561;
- preview shadow: --shadow-page-preview.

## 2. COLOR SYSTEM

### Sampling note

The source is a compressed, downscaled JPEG, but the principal surface colors repeat exactly across tens of thousands of pixels. The first table records those literal raster samples. The matching live theme reveals the intended production CSS values. Use the production values in HTML/CSS: downscaling, antialiasing, and JPEG compression are what shift them into the sampled raster values.

### Core palette

| Token | HEX | Role and exact use |
|---|---|---|
| Canvas | #F7F4ED | Outer presentation canvas; also the flattened-JPEG target for text on photography |
| Header | #F7F6F1 | Header/navigation surface; keep distinct from the canvas |
| Sage surface | #C8CAC5 | Entire “Because these moments…” story section |
| Oatmeal surface | #E8E0D3 | Entire three-card portfolio section |
| Sand surface | #DCCDBA | Biography/profile section |
| Decorative cool gray | #DFE0DA | Presentation-only lower-left and right-side decorative panels |
| Label tan | #D1BFA7 | Vertical portfolio tabs |
| Primary ink | #292825 | Logo, major warm-surface headings, primary text, hover fills |
| Deep ink | #12140F | Highest-contrast heading cores on sage |
| Cool body ink | #565954 | Italic paragraph text on the sage surface |
| Warm body ink | #695E4C | Italic paragraph text on sand and oatmeal surfaces |
| Utility ink | #5D5C59 | Navigation and small sans-serif utility copy |
| Warm label ink | #493D29 | Text inside vertical tan labels |
| On-photo ivory | #F7F4ED | Hero heading and script overlays |
| Muted icon taupe | #C3BAAD | Social icons in the header |
| Cool construction line | #8F928D | Vertical story frame and cool-surface hairlines |
| Warm construction line | #817A70 | Story frame bottom line, biography cross-lines, focus rings |
| Strong control border | #6A6D68 | Outline button border and focused control border |
| Clay photo accent | #8D5933 | Photography grading reference only; not a UI state color |
| Walnut photo accent | #493621 | Photography grading reference only; not a UI state color |
| Disabled neutral | #B7B6B2 | Disabled text, icons, and borders |

### Production CSS palette

| Production token | CSS value | Corresponding flattened sample |
|---|---:|---:|
| Presentation canvas | #F7F4ED | #F7F4ED |
| Site ivory/header | #F8F6F1 | #F7F6F1 |
| Sage surface | #C8CBC5 | #C8CAC5 |
| Oatmeal surface | #E9E0D4 | #E8E0D3 |
| Sand surface | #DBCDBA | #DCCDBA |
| Taupe label/icon | #D1BFA7 | #D1BFA7 |
| Primary ink/lines/borders | #000000 | #292825, #8F928D, #817A70, or #6A6D68 after scaling and antialiasing |
| On-photo/inverse text | #FFFFFF | #F7F4ED through #FFFFF5 after scaling/compression |

The production CSS values are the implementation source of truth. The raster samples are the visual QA targets when the finished page is reduced to the supplied reference size.

Do not merge the canvas, header, oatmeal, and sand colors. Their small differences are part of the design’s layered paper effect.

### Color-to-element map

- Body outside the site preview: --color-canvas.
- Site header: --color-header.
- Hero and banner text: --color-on-photo.
- Story section: --color-surface-sage with --color-heading-cool and --color-body-cool.
- Portfolio section: --color-surface-oatmeal.
- Portfolio tabs: --color-label-tan with --color-label-ink.
- Biography section: --color-surface-sand with --color-ink and --color-body-warm.
- Header social icons: --color-icon-muted; hover to --color-ink.
- Button: transparent background, --color-control-border border, --color-ink text.
- Decorative lines: cool line on sage, warm line where the line crosses oatmeal or sand.
- Keyboard focus: --color-focus-ring at 2 px with 3 px offset.

### Photography-only colors

The following colors are prominent in the photographs but should not be used as additional section backgrounds:

- deep umber: #281E10;
- walnut: #493621;
- warm earth: #604A31;
- clay: #8D5933;
- muted olive: #71674E;
- weathered sand: #B6A997.

These colors define asset selection and color grading. They are not permission to add extra UI colors.

### Gradients and image overlays

No UI surface gradient is visible. Header, sage, oatmeal, sand, and tab surfaces are flat fills. Do not introduce decorative gradients.

The matching production page applies a uniform 10% black overlay to the hero and banner:

- Hero: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.10).
- Full-width banner: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.10).

The flattened raster reads slightly warmer because of the photographs and JPEG encoding. The reference-only approximations are rgba(23, 16, 6, 0.12) for the hero and rgba(19, 11, 1, 0.18) for the banner.

Do not apply a directional gradient unless the replacement photograph has a demonstrated readability problem. If the supplied asset already matches the grade, omit the scrim rather than making the image muddy.

| Banner script | 48 px | 3rem | 400 | 1 / 48 px | 0 | Lowercase sentence |

### Typography behavior

- Headings are uppercase, left aligned in text sections, and centered only when over a full-width photograph.
- Do not fake uppercase by typing mixed-case text and visually transforming only some instances; use text-transform consistently.
- Major serif headings use Idealist 400, normal style, never italic or bold.
- Visible body paragraphs are Crimson Text 400 italic, not display serif and not sans-serif.
- Navigation and utility labels are small, uppercase, and deliberately tracked.
- Script is decorative and should not carry essential information by itself. Preserve equivalent accessible text for screen readers.
- Do not bold display type. The design depends on the fine strokes of Idealist 400.
- Do not use text shadows. Readability comes from image grading and scrims.
- Keep the exact authored line breaks above 1250 px where they are part of the composition.

## 4. SPACING & LAYOUT SYSTEM

### Base spacing

Use a 4 px base unit. Every margin, gap, inset, and padding must resolve to a token unless an exact measured composition value is explicitly listed.

| Token | Value | Typical use |
|---|---:|---|
| --space-0 | 0 | Flush edges |
| --space-1 | 4 px | Optical corrections |
| --space-2 | 8 px | Icon micro-gap |
| --space-3 | 12 px | Tight label gap |
| --space-4 | 16 px | Small component padding |
| --space-5 | 20 px | Small vertical rhythm |
| --space-6 | 24 px | Grid gutter |
| --space-8 | 32 px | Text group gap |
| --space-10 | 40 px | Button or card separation |
| --space-12 | 48 px | Desktop wide gutter |
| --space-16 | 64 px | Header right inset and medium section gap |
| --space-20 | 80 px | Large content separation |
| --space-24 | 96 px | Standard content container margin |
| --space-30 | 120 px | Large section padding |
| --space-32 | 128 px | Portfolio bottom padding |
| --space-40 | 160 px | Editorial whitespace |
| --space-48 | 192 px | Portfolio side inset |
| --space-56 | 224 px | Portfolio top padding |

Exact measured offsets such as 49, 103, 195, 338, 647, 698, 801, and 855 px are intentional calibration coordinates and are permitted as component variables.

### Containers

- Site calibration width: 1500 px.
- Header uses 40 px padding on all sides in the confirmed desktop implementation.
- Wide content width: 1420 px, centered, 40 px side gutters.
- Standard content width: 1305 px, or 87% of the viewport, centered.
- Portfolio row uses an 87% inner width; its measured visible image group is approximately 1110 px wide and centered.
- Mobile side gutter: 24 px between 480 and 767 px; 20 px below 480 px.

The production site may expand beyond the 1500 px calibration width, but content geometry must stop growing at the stated max-widths. Full-bleed section backgrounds and photography may continue to the viewport edge.

### Grid

- Primary grid: 12 columns.
- Desktop wide-grid outer margin: 40 px.
- Desktop gutter: 24 px.
- Use CSS Grid for macro layout and absolute positioning only inside the two art-directed photo-collage components.
- Portfolio: three equal measured image columns near 302 px wide with approximately 99 px visible gaps. The live component uses three equal columns inside an 87% inner wrapper and 50 px card-side margins.
- Story section: live columns are 27% arched image, 22% foreground image, and 51% copy.
- Biography section: live columns are 46.5% copy and 53.5% portrait.

### Exact desktop vertical bands

| Section | Reference y-range | Reference height | Canonical height |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Header | 149–210 | 61 px | Approximately 114–118 px |
| Hero | 210–573 | 363 px | 675 px confirmed |
| Story | 573–910 | 337 px | Approximately 632 px at calibration width |
| Portfolio | 910–1307 | 397 px | Approximately 744 px; 230 px top and 135 px bottom padding confirmed |
| Image banner | 1307–1576 | 269 px | 500 px confirmed |
| Biography | 1576–1850+ | 274 px visible | Approximately 514 px visible and continuing |

Allow a ±2 px implementation tolerance after calibration rounding.

### Section padding and gaps

- Header: 40 px on all sides; vertically centered.
- Hero: no outer padding.
- Story: the arched image uses a 50 px top/left margin; the foreground image uses a 150 px top offset and negative 65 px overlap.
- Portfolio: 230 px top padding and 135 px bottom padding.
- Image banner: no outer padding.
- Biography: portrait column begins with a 100 px top margin; copy is vertically centered.

### Header and footer

- Header visible height is approximately 114–118 px, determined by the 38 px wordmark and 40 px top/bottom padding.
- No footer appears in the source. Do not insert a footer into the visible reconstruction.
- If a future page requires a footer, it must be designed as a new approved extension using only this palette and typography. It must not be treated as pixel-derived from this image.

- Entire image and tab form one link with a 44 px minimum target.

**Vertical tab**

- Rotated visible size: approximately 43 × 245 px.
- Background: --color-label-tan.
- Unrotated link width: 245 px; padding:15px 20px.
- Source position uses a top offset near 55 px and a horizontal offset near -70 px from the image-side anchor. Final rendered placement begins approximately 43 px above the image and ends 29–30 px inside its right edge.
- Radius/border/shadow: none.
- Text: 14 px Cabin 400, uppercase, 2.5 px tracking.
- Implement with transform:rotate(-90deg), matching the source.
- Center text in both axes.

**Labels**

1. THE PORTFOLIO
2. THE EXPERIENCE
3. READ MY JOURNAL

**States**

- Hover image: scale to 1.025 over 500 ms; image wrapper clips overflow.
- Hover tab: background --color-surface-sage; text remains --color-label-ink.
- Focus-visible: outline the complete card with 2 px --color-focus-ring and 4 px offset.
- Active: image scale 1.01; tab background --color-ink; tab text --color-on-photo.

### 5.7 Full-width photographic banner

- Canonical size: 1500 × 500 px.
- Reference size: 800 × 269 px.
- Aspect ratio: 2.97:1.
- Image: object-fit:cover; object-position:50% 43%.

- Corners/border/shadow: none.
- Script phrase centered at x=750 px, y≈250 px.
- Phrase: “when all you need is love.”
- Script size: 48 px Modernline.
- Color: rgba(247, 244, 237, 0.82).
- No other copy or call-to-action is visible.

### 5.8 Biography section

Only 274 reference pixels, approximately 514 CSS pixels at calibration, are visible; the section and image continue below the crop.

- Background: --color-surface-sand.
- Position: relative.
- Approximately 514 px are visible at the 1500 px calibration; do not treat that as the confirmed final section height.

**Copy**

- Left column share: 46.5%.
- Horizontal padding: 7%.
- Calibration left: approximately x=103 px.
- Calibration top: approximately y=225 px.
- Width: about 473 px.
- Heading: H2, three lines.
- Body: 21 px Crimson Text italic; margin-top 13 px; max-width about 460 px.
- Text colors: --color-ink and --color-body-warm.

Heading:

“HEY, I'M DELPHINE. AND I  
CAN'T WAIT TO CAPTURE  
YOUR STORY”

**Construction lines**

- Right image column carries a 1 px left border.
- Calibration vertical line: x≈698 px, beginning around y=99 px and continuing below the crop.
- A 1 px horizontal divider extends approximately 200 px from the column boundary toward/behind the portrait.
- Stroke: 1 px solid --color-line-warm.
- Lines sit behind the image.

- Square lower corners.
- Object-fit:cover; object-position:60% 45%.
- No shadow or border.

### 5.9 Decorative hairlines

- Width: 1 px at all breakpoints.
- Never use 2 px decorative lines.
- Color depends on surface: cool line on sage, warm line on oatmeal/sand.
- They must align to whole CSS pixels at 1× rendering to avoid blur.
- Hairlines encode the collage geometry; do not add arbitrary frames around other content.

### 5.10 Forms, badges, and footer

- No form, conventional badge, or footer is visible.
- Do not claim pixel-derived dimensions for absent components.
- If a future form is required, use square fields, transparent or matching-surface backgrounds, 1 px --color-control-border borders, serif 16 px inputs, uppercase 11 px sans labels, and the standard focus ring.
- Never use pill badges. The existing vertical rectangular portfolio tab is the system’s label pattern.
- A future footer requires a separate composition review; it may reuse the palette and type tokens but must not be inserted into the source reconstruction.

## 6. IMAGERY & ICONOGRAPHY

### Photography direction

Use candid, documentary-style couple, wedding, and photographer portraits. Subjects should appear mid-movement or in quiet interaction rather than posed against studio backdrops.

Required visual properties:

- warm golden-hour or warm indoor light;
- subdued saturation;
- deep brown or olive shadows;
- creamy, low-chroma highlights;
- visible natural texture and slight grain;
- restrained contrast with soft highlight roll-off;
- earth-tone clothing and scenery;
- no neon colors, cold blue casts, high-clarity HDR, or glossy commercial lighting.

### Image treatments

| Image | Ratio/size | Crop | Shape |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hero | 2.20:1 | 50% 48% | Full-bleed rectangle |
| Story rear | 378 × 491 | 43% 50% | Semicircular top, square bottom |
| Story front | 382 × 495 | 52% 45% | Square rectangle |
| Portfolio cards | Approximately 302 × 381 at 1500 px calibration | Subject-specific center crop | Square rectangle |
| Banner | 2.97:1 | 50% 43% | Full-bleed rectangle |
| Biography | 571 px wide, height continues | 60% 45% | Semicircular top, square bottom |

Apply color correction only when necessary:

~~~css
.photo--editorial {
  filter: saturate(0.78) contrast(0.94) brightness(0.90) sepia(0.08);
}
~~~

Do not stack this filter on assets that are already graded to match.

### Icons

- Style: minimal line or simple brand glyph.
- Visible size: 14–16 px.
- Stroke width: 1.5 px.
- Color: muted taupe.
- Suggested libraries: Simple Icons for brands; Lucide for chevrons and generic icons.
- Do not mix filled emoji, multicolor brand marks, and outline icons.
- Keep the four-icon header group visually quiet; it must not compete with the logo.

## 7. EFFECTS & MOTION

### Shadows

The live website contains no visible component shadows. Cards, images, buttons, and the header remain flat.

The only prominent shadow belongs to the outer presentation preview:

~~~css
:root {
  --shadow-none: none;
  --shadow-page-preview:
    0 18px 24px -5px rgba(30, 28, 24, 0.45),
    0 5px 10px rgba(30, 28, 24, 0.16);
  --shadow-focus: 0 0 0 3px rgba(129, 122, 112, 0.32);
}
~~~

### Radius system

- --radius-none: 0.
- --radius-control: 0.
- --radius-card: 0.
- --radius-arch: 999px 999px 0 0.
- --radius-round: 999px, reserved for invisible hit zones or genuinely circular icons, not cards.

Do not introduce 8–24 px rounded rectangles. They conflict with the source.

### Motion

Motion is inferred because the source is static. It must remain slow, editorial, and subordinate to photography.

- Standard UI transition: 180 ms ease-out.
- Dropdown fade/translate and chevron rotation: 220 ms cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1).
- Image hover: 500 ms cubic-bezier(0.215, 0.61, 0.355, 1).
- Optional scroll reveal: 600 ms cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1), opacity 0→1 and translateY(12px)→0.
- Stagger between related items: no more than 80 ms.
- Hero copy entrance: 800 ms; script may follow the serif line by 120 ms.
- Active press: 100 ms.

Do not use bounce, elastic easing, large parallax, spinning, continuous floating, or animated gradients.

Honor prefers-reduced-motion: reduce:

- remove transforms and parallax;
- set animation duration to 1 ms;
- retain state changes through color and outline only.

## 8. RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR

Responsive behavior is inferred from the desktop source. Preserve hierarchy, color rhythm, arch geometry, and deliberate overlaps rather than shrinking the entire page with transform:scale().

### Breakpoints

| Name | Range | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Desktop | Above 1250 px | Full composition and confirmed desktop values |
| Laptop | 1051–1250 px | Reduced fixed heights and portfolio spacing |
| Tablet | 768–1050 px | Burger header; compact three-card row; reduced type |
| Mobile | 0–767 px | Two-row header and stacked editorial sections |

Use the exact source breakpoints: 1250 px, 1050 px, and 767 px.

### Desktop: above 1250 px

- Header padding: 40 px.
- Logo: 38 px; navigation: 12.5 px; social icons: 18 px.
- H1/H2/H3/script: 50/42/32/48 px.
- Body: 21 px.
- Hero min-height: 675 px.
- Portfolio padding: 230 px 0 135 px.
- Banner min-height: 500 px.
- Story remains a 27% / 22% / 51% three-part row.
- Biography remains a 46.5% / 53.5% two-column split.

### Laptop: 1051–1250 px

- Hero min-height: 600 px.
- Banner min-height: 450 px.
- Portfolio padding: 215 px 0 135 px.
- Card side margins: 30 px.
- Biography bottom margin: 160 px.
- Portrait-column top margin: 75 px; column padding: 5%.
- Preserve the desktop nav and three-card row.

### Tablet: 768–1050 px

- Replace the desktop navigation with a burger control.
- Header padding: 30 px.
- Center the 36 px logo.
- Burger visible size: 25 px; hit area: 44 px.
- H1/H2/H3/script: 45/37/30/43 px.
- Body: 20 px.
- Hero min-height: 525 px.
- Banner min-height: 400 px.
- Portfolio padding: 167 px 0 110 px.
- Card side margins: 15 px.
- Vertical labels: 13 px, 225 px unrotated width, horizontal offset around -60 px.
- Story may keep its row while space allows; give the copy column sufficient inner padding and reduce overlap offsets proportionally.
- Biography receives 90 px top/bottom padding and 118 px bottom margin.

### Mobile: 0–767 px

- Header padding: 15px 20px 0.
- Header becomes two rows: burger column 30%, social column 70%, then a full-width centered logo beneath.
- Logo: 32 px with padding 15px 0 25px.
- Burger: 20 px visible, 44 px target.
- H1/H2/H3/script: 40/34/29/37 px.
- Body: no smaller than 19 px where the original prose scale is retained; 16 px is the absolute accessibility floor.
- Labels: 13 px; smallest metadata: 12.5 px.
- Hero min-height: 375 px. Use a portrait-specific image/crop positioned top center.
- Story images remain a 60% / 40% pair; the copy becomes a full-width row below with 10% 8% 13% top/horizontal/bottom padding.
- Portfolio padding: 90 px 0 80 px.
- Portfolio inner side margins: 12%.
- Stack cards one per row with 80 px between them.
- Keep the vertical-label offset near -65 px.
- Banner min-height: 350 px.
- Biography stacks portrait before copy.
- Biography image block: margin 0 8%; remove the left border; add a 1 px bottom border and 35 px bottom padding.
- Biography copy: margin-top 30 px; 8% horizontal padding.
- Biography section: 60 px top and 65 px bottom padding, plus 110 px bottom margin.

### Responsive hard constraints

- Never allow horizontal scrolling.
- Never distort images; use object-fit:cover.
- Never scale body text below 16 px.
- Never make utility text smaller than 10 px.
- Preserve the order of sections and the alternating sage → oatmeal → photo → sand rhythm.
- Do not remove the arches on mobile.
- Do not convert the page into generic rounded cards.

## 9. SECTION-BY-SECTION BLUEPRINT

### 9.1 Presentation layer, optional

Create a warm off-white 1080 × 1920 showcase canvas. Place three pale, partially hidden still-life rectangles behind an 800 px-wide site screenshot. Center the site at x=140 and y=149. Apply the page-preview shadow. This layer is excluded from production.

### 9.2 Header

Use the confirmed 40 px header padding and 38 px Idealist wordmark. Arrange the desktop header as 30% logo, 57% navigation, and 13% social icons. Align five uppercase Cabin links across the right portion, followed by Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, and heart icons. Add small chevrons to LAYOUTS and SALES. Keep the header entirely flat and unbordered.

Suggested semantic structure:

~~~html
<header class="site-header">
  <a class="wordmark">DELPHINE ROSE</a>
  <nav class="primary-nav">…</nav>
  <div class="social-nav">…</div>
</header>
~~~

### 9.3 Hero

Place a full-width desert couple photograph directly below the header in a 675 px minimum-height frame. Center the couple near the horizontal midpoint. Apply the 10% dark overlay. Center the 50 px ivory Idealist title over the couple, then overlap it with the 48 px Modernline phrase. Keep all edges square and omit additional controls.

### 9.4 Story section

Begin the sage block as a 27% / 22% / 51% row. Draw an open construction frame from the section’s left edge, with its measured right line near x=647 in the 1500 px calibration and its bottom line extending into the next section.

Place the arched image with margin 50px -20px 0 50px. Overlay the phrase “the love story” near its bottom. Place the square-cornered portrait using margin 150px 0 -35px -65px so it overlaps the rear image and crosses the sage/oatmeal boundary.

Vertically center the copy column with 8.25% horizontal padding. Place the three-line serif statement, then the Crimson Text italic paragraph 13 px below, followed by the outlined LEARN MORE button after approximately 29 px. Align the heading’s top optically with the foreground image.

### 9.5 Portfolio row

Continue with the oatmeal block using 230 px top and 135 px bottom padding. Preserve the story collage and line overlap at its top. Center three portrait links inside an 87% wrapper, with approximately 50 px card-side margins on wide desktop. Position each 245 px unrotated tan label using rotate(-90deg) near the image’s upper-right.

### 9.6 Image banner

Place a 1500 × 500 px warm, dark, full-bleed couple photograph with a 10% black overlay. Center the 48 px Modernline phrase “when all you need is love.” slightly above or at the optical vertical center. Use no other text, button, inset, or border.

### 9.7 Biography introduction

Switch to the sand surface and create a 46.5% copy / 53.5% portrait split. The right column has a 1 px left border, 100 px top margin, -30 px bottom margin, and 7% horizontal padding. Extend a 200 px horizontal rule from the boundary toward the arched portrait. Vertically center the left copy with 7% horizontal padding. Use the three-line H2 statement followed 13 px later by a short Crimson Text italic paragraph. Allow the portrait and line to continue below the supplied reference crop.

### 9.8 Source endpoint

The reference ends during the biography section. Do not infer a page ending, footer, or additional call-to-action from the crop. Any continuation must follow the same palette, type, spacing, and image rules but is not part of the pixel-perfect source blueprint.

## 10. IMPLEMENTATION RULES

### Hard rules

1. Use the 1500 px calibration coordinate system and approximately 1.875 conversion factor for source-image validation.
2. Use only the declared color tokens. Do not introduce pure #000000, pure #FFFFFF, bright accent colors, or extra beige variants.
3. Do not collapse the four pale surfaces into one color.
4. Use Idealist for display, Modernline for script, Cabin for interface copy, and Crimson Text italic for prose. If the custom fonts are not licensed, substitute Cormorant Garamond and Allura.
5. Use spacing tokens for normal flow. Use exact component coordinates only for the measured collages and construction lines.
6. Ordinary cards, buttons, images, and sections use zero border radius.
7. Only arched photographs receive large radii.
8. Use 1 px construction lines and borders. Do not thicken decorative lines.
9. Do not add shadows to live-site cards, images, buttons, or the header.
10. Apply the page shadow only to the optional presentation preview.
11. Keep photographs warm, muted, candid, and textural.
12. Never stretch photographs. Use object-fit:cover and the documented object positions.
13. Use no decorative UI gradients. Use only the optional uniform photo scrims.
14. Limit script typography to one short phrase per photo composition.
15. Keep major statements uppercase serif, body copy italic serif, and utilities uppercase sans-serif.
16. Preserve desktop line breaks where specified.
17. Keep all visible interactive targets at least 44 × 44 px.
18. Provide keyboard focus indicators and reduced-motion behavior.
19. Preserve section order and surface rhythm.
20. Do not invent a footer inside the visible source reconstruction.
21. Use the exact responsive thresholds 1250 px, 1050 px, and 767 px.
